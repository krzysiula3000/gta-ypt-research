This documentation is intended to help you play around with the behavior of particles, 
and to create a template for further documentation ** ~ NOT TO CREATE THEM FROM SCRATCH ~ **
																						
																						
from what i understand after playing with the file, many particle effects don't have a dedicated mesh, 
only a plane that's automatically generated and the texture specified in the .ypt is applied
onto it, whenever the particle plays 
																						
																						
																						
Many keyframe properties have 2 variations, one with *Min*and the other with *Max*
in their names, when the two values are not exactly equal, the game will use a random
value from within that range
