# All unknown0 info gathered as for now

### **NOTE**
unknown4 is closely related to unknown0, we (i and w/#7263) suspect it might be responsible for interpolation, however there seem to be no way for us to find out,
here are some commonly used values:
-  `0`,  `1.25`,  `2.5`,  `5`,  `10`,  `12,5`,  `20`
